  abstract = {Comparison of the performance and accuracy of different inference methods, such as maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference, is difficult because the inference methods are implemented in different programs, often written by different authors. Both methods were implemented in the program MIGRATE, that estimates population genetic parameters, such as population sizes and migration rates, using coalescence theory. Both inference methods use the same Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and differ from each other in only two aspects: parameter proposal distribution and maximization of the likelihood function. Using simulated datasets, the Bayesian method generally fares better than the ML approach in accuracy and coverage, although for some values the two approaches are equal in performance.Motivation: The Markov chain Monte Carlo-based ML framework can fail on sparse data and can deliver non-conservative support intervals. A Bayesian framework with appropriate prior distribution is able to remedy some of these problems.Results: The program MIGRATE was extended to allow not only for ML(-) maximum likelihood estimation of population genetics parameters but also for using a Bayesian framework. Comparisons between the Bayesian approach and the ML approach are facilitated because both modes estimate the same parameters under the same population model and assumptions.},

  abstract = {Current estimators of gene flow come in two methods; those that estimate parameters assuming that the populations investigated are a small random sample of a large number of populations and those that assume that all populations were sampled. Maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches that estimate the migration rates and population sizes directly using coalescent theory can easily accommodate datasets that contain a population that has no data, a so-called \&apos;ghost\&apos; population. This manipulation allows us to explore the effects of missing populations on the estimation of population sizes and migration rates between two specific populations. The biases of the inferred population parameters depend on the magnitude of the migration rate from the unknown populations. The effects on the population sizes are larger than the effects on the migration rates. The more immigrants from the unknown populations that are arriving in the sample populations the larger the estimated population sizes. Taking into account a ghost population improves or at least does not harm the estimation of population sizes. Estimates of the scaled migration rate M (migration rate per generation divided by the mutation rate per generation) are fairly robust as long as migration rates from the unknown populations are not huge. The inclusion of a ghost population does not improve the estimation of the migration rate M; when the migration rates are estimated as the number of immigrants Nm then a ghost population improves the estimates because of its effect on population size estimation. It seems that for \&apos;real world\&apos; analyses one should carefully choose which populations to sample, but there is no need to sample every population in the neighbourhood of a population of interest.},

These sampling locations often do not reflect the genetic population structure. We describe a framework using marginal likelihoods to compare and order structured population models, such as testing whether the sampling locations belong to the same randomly mating population or comparing unidirectional and multidirectional gene flow models. In the context of inferences employing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, the accuracy of the marginal likelihoods depends heavily on the approximation method used to calculate the marginal likelihood. Two methods, modified thermodynamic integration and a stabilized harmonic mean estimator, are compared. With finite Markov chain Monte Carlo run lengths, the harmonic mean estimator may not be consistent. Thermodynamic integration, in contrast, delivers considerably better estimates of the marginal likelihood. The choice of prior distributions does not influence the order and choice of the better models when the marginal likelihood is estimated using thermodynamic integration, whereas with the harmonic mean estimator the influence of the prior is pronounced and the order of the models changes. The approximation of marginal likelihood using thermodynamic integration in MIGRATE allows the evaluation of complex population genetic models, not only of whether sampling locations belong to a single panmictic population, but also of competing complex structured population models.},

  abstract = {The restriction site-associated DNA (RADseq) family of protocols involves digesting DNA and sequencing the region flanking the cut site, thus providing a cost and time-efficient way for obtaining thousands of genomic markers. However, when working with non-model taxa with few genomic resources, optimization of RADseq wet-lab and bioinformatic tools may be challenging, often resulting in allele dropout\textemdash that is when a given RADseq locus is not sequenced in one or more individuals resulting in missing data. Additionally, as datasets include divergent taxa, rates of dropout will increase since restriction sites may be lost due to mutation. Mitigating the impacts of allele dropout is crucial, as missing data may lead to incorrect inferences in population genetics and phylogenetics. Here, we demonstrate a simple pipeline for the optimization of RADseq datasets which involves partitioning datasets into subgroups, namely by reducing and analysing the dataset at a population or species level. By running the software Stacks at a subgroup level, we were able to reliably identify and remove individuals with high levels of missing data (bad apples) likely stemming from artefacts in library preparation, DNA quality or sequencing artefacts. Removal of the bad apples generally led to an increase in loci and decrease in missing data in the final datasets. The biological interpretability of the data, as measured by the number of retrieved loci and missing data, was considerably increased.},

  abstract = {Marine species in the Indo-Pacific have ranges that can span thousands of kilometres, yet studies increasingly suggest that mean larval dispersal distances are less than historically assumed. Gene flow across these ranges must therefore rely to some extent on larval dispersal among intermediate \&apos;stepping-stone\&apos; populations in combination with long-distance dispersal far beyond the mean of the dispersal kernel. We evaluate the strength of stepping-stone dynamics by employing a spatially explicit biophysical model of larval dispersal in the tropical Pacific to construct hypotheses for dispersal pathways. We evaluate these hypotheses with coalescent models of gene flow among high-island archipelagos in four neritid gastropod species. Two of the species live in the marine intertidal, while the other two are amphidromous, living in fresh water but retaining pelagic dispersal. Dispersal pathways predicted by the biophysical model were strongly favoured in 16 of 18 tests against alternate hypotheses. In regions where connectivity among high-island archipelagos was predicted as direct, there was no difference in gene flow between marine and amphidromous species. In regions where connectivity was predicted through stepping-stone atolls only accessible to marine species, gene flow estimates between high-island archipelagos were significantly higher in marine species. Moreover, one of the marine species showed a significant pattern of isolation by distance consistent with stepping-stone dynamics. While our results support stepping-stone dynamics in Indo-Pacific species, we also see evidence for nonequilibrium processes such as range expansions or rare long-distance dispersal events. This study couples population genetic and biophysical models to help to shed light on larval dispersal pathways.},

We investigate range-wide population genetic structure of the California spiny (or red rock) lobster (Panulirus interruptus) and find slight, but significant global population differentiation in mtDNA ({$\Phi$}ST ~=~0.006, P~=~0.001; Dest\_Chao ~=~0.025) and seven nuclear microsatellites (FST ~=~0.004, P~\&lt;~0.001; Dest\_Chao ~=~0.03), despite the species\&apos; 240- to 330-day pelagic larval duration. Significant population structure does not correlate with distance between sampling locations, and pairwise FST between adjacent sites often exceeds that among geographically distant locations. This result would typically be interpreted as unexplainable, chaotic genetic patchiness. However, kinship levels differ significantly among sites (pseudo-F16,988 ~=~1.39, P~=~0.001), and ten of 17 sample sites have significantly greater numbers of kin than expected by chance (P~\&lt;~0.05). Moreover, a higher proportion of kin within sites strongly correlates with greater genetic differentiation among sites (Dest\_Chao , R(2) ~=~0.66, P~\&lt;~0.005). Sites with elevated mean kinship were geographically proximate to regions of high upwelling intensity (R(2) ~=~0.41, P~=~0.0009). These results indicate that P.~interruptus does not maintain a single homogenous population, despite extreme dispersal potential. Instead, these lobsters appear to either have substantial localized recruitment or maintain planktonic larval cohesiveness whereby siblings more likely settle together than disperse across sites. More broadly, our results contribute to a growing number of studies showing that low FST and high family structure across populations can coexist, illuminating the foundations of cryptic genetic patterns and the nature of marine dispersal.},

Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

  abstract = {Despite the popularity of discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) for studying population structure, there has been little discussion of best practice for this method. In this work, I provide guidelines for standardizing the application of DAPC to genotype data sets. An often overlooked fact is that DAPC generates a model describing genetic differences among a set of populations defined by a researcher. Appropriate parameterization of this model is critical for obtaining biologically meaningful results. I show that the number of leading PC axes used as predictors of among-population differences, paxes, should not exceed the k-1 biologically informative PC axes that are expected for k effective populations in a genotype data set. This k-1 criterion for paxes specification is more appropriate compared to the widely used proportional variance criterion, which often results in a choice of paxes {$\gg$} k-1. DAPC parameterized with no more than the leading k-1 PC axes: (i) is more parsimonious; (ii) captures maximal among-population variation on biologically relevant predictors; (iii) is less sensitive to unintended interpretations of population structure; and (iv) is more generally applicable to independent sample sets. Assessing model fit should be routine practice and aids interpretation of population structure. It is imperative that researchers articulate their study goals, that is, testing a priori expectations vs. studying de novo inferred populations, because this has implications on how their DAPC results should be interpreted. The discussion and practical recommendations in this work provide the molecular ecology community with a roadmap for using DAPC in population genetic investigations.},
