Attempted to assemble and align paired-end reads for 2545299 loci:
  0 loci had no or almost no paired-end reads (0.0%);
  72580 loci had paired-end reads that couldn't be assembled into a contig (2.9%);
  For the remaining 2472719 loci (97.1%), a paired-end contig was assembled;
    Average contig size was 237.5 bp;
  2058228 paired-end contigs overlapped the forward region (83.2%)
    Mean overlap: 30.1bp; mean size of overlapped loci after merging: 223.4;
  Out of 77300282 paired-end reads in these loci (mean 30.6 reads per locus),
    75710772 were successfuly aligned (97.9%);
  Mean insert length was 238.3, stdev: 69.4 (based on aligned reads in overlapped loci).

Genotyped 2472655 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=8.7x, stdev=1.0x, min=5.3x, max=10.1x
