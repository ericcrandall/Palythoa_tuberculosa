  abstract = {It is commonly assumed that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) evolves at a faster rate than nuclear DNA (nuDNA) in animals. This has contributed to the popularity of mtDNA as a molecular marker in evolutionary studies. Analyzing 121 multilocus data sets and four phylogenomic data sets encompassing 4,676 species of animals, we demonstrate that the ratio of mitochondrial over nuclear mutation rate is highly variable among animal taxa. In nonvertebrates, such as insects and arachnids, the ratio of mtDNA over nuDNA mutation rate varies between 2 and 6, whereas it is above 20, on average, in vertebrates such as scaled reptiles and birds. Interestingly, this variation is sufficient to explain the previous report of a similar level of mitochondrial polymorphism, on average, between vertebrates and nonvertebrates, which was originally interpreted as reflecting the effect of pervasive positive selection. Our analysis rather indicates that the among-phyla homogeneity in within-species mtDNA diversity is due to a negative correlation between mtDNA per-generation mutation rate and effective population size, irrespective of the action of natural selection. Finally, we explore the variation in the absolute per-year mutation rate of both mtDNA and nuDNA using a reduced data set for which fossil calibration is available, and discuss the potential determinants of mutation rate variation across genomes and taxa. This study has important implications regarding DNA-based identification methods in predicting that mtDNA barcoding should be less reliable in nonvertebrates than in vertebrates.},

  abstract = {A common approach to estimate the strength and direction of selection acting on protein coding sequences is to calculate the dN/dS ratio. The method to calculate dN/dS has been widely used by many researchers and many critical reviews have been made on its application after the proposition by Nei and Gojobori in 1986. However, the method is still evolving considering the non-uniform substitution rates and pretermination codons. In our study of SNPs in 586 genes across 156 Escherichia coli strains, synonymous polymorphism in 2-fold degenerate codons were higher in comparison to that in 4-fold degenerate codons, which could be attributed to the difference between transition (Ti) and transversion (Tv) substitution rates where the average rate of a transition is four times more than that of a transversion in general. We considered both the Ti/Tv ratio, and nonsense mutation in pretermination codons, to improve estimates of synonymous (S) and non-synonymous (NS) sites. The accuracy of estimating dN/dS has been improved by considering the Ti/Tv ratio and nonsense substitutions in pretermination codons. We showed that applying the modified approach based on Ti/Tv ratio and pretermination codons results in higher values of dN/dS in 29 common genes of equal reading-frames between E. coli and Salmonella enterica. This study emphasizes the robustness of amino acid composition with varying codon degeneracy, as well as the pretermination codons when calculating dN/dS values.},

Both inference methods use the same Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and differ from each other in only two aspects: parameter proposal distribution and maximization of the likelihood function. Using simulated datasets, the Bayesian method generally fares better than the ML approach in accuracy and coverage, although for some values the two approaches are equal in performance.Motivation: The Markov chain Monte Carlo-based ML framework can fail on sparse data and can deliver non-conservative support intervals. A Bayesian framework with appropriate prior distribution is able to remedy some of these problems.Results: The program MIGRATE was extended to allow not only for ML(-) maximum likelihood estimation of population genetics parameters but also for using a Bayesian framework. Comparisons between the Bayesian approach and the ML approach are facilitated because both modes estimate the same parameters under the same population model and assumptions.},

Maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches that estimate the migration rates and population sizes directly using coalescent theory can easily accommodate datasets that contain a population that has no data, a so-called \&apos;ghost\&apos; population. This manipulation allows us to explore the effects of missing populations on the estimation of population sizes and migration rates between two specific populations. The biases of the inferred population parameters depend on the magnitude of the migration rate from the unknown populations. The effects on the population sizes are larger than the effects on the migration rates. The more immigrants from the unknown populations that are arriving in the sample populations the larger the estimated population sizes. Taking into account a ghost population improves or at least does not harm the estimation of population sizes. Estimates of the scaled migration rate M (migration rate per generation divided by the mutation rate per generation) are fairly robust as long as migration rates from the unknown populations are not huge. The inclusion of a ghost population does not improve the estimation of the migration rate M; when the migration rates are estimated as the number of immigrants Nm then a ghost population improves the estimates because of its effect on population size estimation. It seems that for \&apos;real world\&apos; analyses one should carefully choose which populations to sample, but there is no need to sample every population in the neighbourhood of a population of interest.},

MIGRATE, a useful tool for exploring relationships between populations and comparing hypotheses, has existed since 1998. Throughout the years, it has steadily improved in both the quality of algorithms used and in the efficiency of carrying out those calculations, thus allowing for a larger number of loci to be evaluated. This efficiency has been enhanced, as MIGRATE has been developed to perform many of its calculations concurrently when running on a computer cluster. The program is based on the coalescence theory and uses Bayesian inference to estimate posterior probability densities of all the parameters of a user-specified population model. Complex models, which include migration and colonization parameters, can be specified. These models can be evaluated using marginal likelihoods, thus allowing a user to compare the merits of different hypotheses. The three presented protocols will help novice users to develop sophisticated analysis techniques useful for their research projects. {\copyright} 2019 The Authors.

These sampling locations often do not reflect the genetic population structure. We describe a framework using marginal likelihoods to compare and order structured population models, such as testing whether the sampling locations belong to the same randomly mating population or comparing unidirectional and multidirectional gene flow models. In the context of inferences employing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, the accuracy of the marginal likelihoods depends heavily on the approximation method used to calculate the marginal likelihood. Two methods, modified thermodynamic integration and a stabilized harmonic mean estimator, are compared. With finite Markov chain Monte Carlo run lengths, the harmonic mean estimator may not be consistent. Thermodynamic integration, in contrast, delivers considerably better estimates of the marginal likelihood. The choice of prior distributions does not influence the order and choice of the better models when the marginal likelihood is estimated using thermodynamic integration, whereas with the harmonic mean estimator the influence of the prior is pronounced and the order of the models changes. The approximation of marginal likelihood using thermodynamic integration in MIGRATE allows the evaluation of complex population genetic models, not only of whether sampling locations belong to a single panmictic population, but also of competing complex structured population models.},

  abstract = {The restriction site-associated DNA (RADseq) family of protocols involves digesting DNA and sequencing the region flanking the cut site, thus providing a cost and time-efficient way for obtaining thousands of genomic markers. However, when working with non-model taxa with few genomic resources, optimization of RADseq wet-lab and bioinformatic tools may be challenging, often resulting in allele dropout---that is when a given RADseq locus is not sequenced in one or more individuals resulting in missing data. Additionally, as datasets include divergent taxa, rates of dropout will increase since restriction sites may be lost due to mutation. Mitigating the impacts of allele dropout is crucial, as missing data may lead to incorrect inferences in population genetics and phylogenetics. Here, we demonstrate a simple pipeline for the optimization of RADseq datasets which involves partitioning datasets into subgroups, namely by reducing and analysing the dataset at a population or species level. By running the software Stacks at a subgroup level, we were able to reliably identify and remove individuals with high levels of missing data (bad apples) likely stemming from artefacts in library preparation, DNA quality or sequencing artefacts. Removal of the bad apples generally led to an increase in loci and decrease in missing data in the final datasets. The biological interpretability of the data, as measured by the number of retrieved loci and missing data, was considerably increased.},

  abstract = {Marine species in the Indo-Pacific have ranges that can span thousands of kilometres, yet studies increasingly suggest that mean larval dispersal distances are less than historically assumed. Gene flow across these ranges must therefore rely to some extent on larval dispersal among intermediate \&apos;stepping-stone\&apos; populations in combination with long-distance dispersal far beyond the mean of the dispersal kernel. We evaluate the strength of stepping-stone dynamics by employing a spatially explicit biophysical model of larval dispersal in the tropical Pacific to construct hypotheses for dispersal pathways. We evaluate these hypotheses with coalescent models of gene flow among high-island archipelagos in four neritid gastropod species. Two of the species live in the marine intertidal, while the other two are amphidromous, living in fresh water but retaining pelagic dispersal. Dispersal pathways predicted by the biophysical model were strongly favoured in 16 of 18 tests against alternate hypotheses. In regions where connectivity among high-island archipelagos was predicted as direct, there was no difference in gene flow between marine and amphidromous species. In regions where connectivity was predicted through stepping-stone atolls only accessible to marine species, gene flow estimates between high-island archipelagos were significantly higher in marine species. Moreover, one of the marine species showed a significant pattern of isolation by distance consistent with stepping-stone dynamics. While our results support stepping-stone dynamics in Indo-Pacific species, we also see evidence for nonequilibrium processes such as range expansions or rare long-distance dispersal events. This study couples population genetic and biophysical models to help to shed light on larval dispersal pathways.},

First, we review examples where genetic differentiation at specific loci was driven by diversifying selection, which was historically the first process invoked to explain CGP. Second, we turn to neutral demographic processes that may drive genome-wide effects, and whose effects on CGP may be enhanced when they act together. We discuss how sweepstakes reproductive success accelerates genetic drift and can thus generate genetic structure, provided that gene flow is not too strong. Collective dispersal is another mechanism whereby genetic structure can be maintained regardless of dispersal intensity, because it may prevent larval cohorts from becoming entirely mixed. Theoretical analyses of both the sweepstakes and the collective dispersal ideas are presented. Finally, we discuss an idea that has received less attention than the other ones just mentioned, namely temporal shifts in local population dynamics.},

  abstract = {1 Spatially explicit Bayesian clustering techniques offer a powerful tool for ecology and wildlife management, as genetic divisions can be correlated with landscape features. We used these methods to analyse the genetic structure of a population of European wild boar Sus scrofa with the aim of identifying effective barriers for disease management units. However, it has been suggested that the methods could produce biased results when faced with deviations from random mating not caused by genetic discontinuities, such as isolation by distance (IBD). 2 We analysed a data set consisting of 697 wild boar multilocus genotypes using spatially explicit (baps, geneland) and non-explicit (structure) Bayesian methods. We also simulated and analysed data sets characterized by different degrees of IBD, with and without genetic discontinuities. 3 When analysing the empirical data set, different programs did not converge on the same clustering solution and some clusters were difficult to explain biologically. Results from the simulated data showed that IBD, also present in the empirical data set, could cause the Bayesian methods to overestimate genetic structure. Simulated barriers were identified correctly, but the programs superimposed further clusters at higher IBD levels . 4 It was not possible to ascertain with confidence whether the clustering solutions offered by the various programs were an accurate reflection of population genetic structure in our empirical data set or were artefacts created by the underlying IBD pattern. 5 Synthesis and applications: We show that Bayesian clustering methods can overestimate genetic structure when analysing an individual-based data set characterized by isolation by distance. This bias could lead to the erroneous delimitation of management or conservation units. Investigators should be critical and suspicious of clusters that cannot be explained biologically. Data sets should be tested for isolation by distance and conclusions should not be based on the output from just one method.},

P. tuberculosa released zygotes just after high tide around new moon nights. The mean diameter of zygotes was 365.6 Ϯ s.d.14.8 ␮m, and zygotes did not contain any symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae). About 2 h after spawning, the first cleavage furrow appeared on one side of the zygotes, although it was uncertain when eggs were fertilized. After second cleavage, the arrangement of blastomeres was pseudospherical. At 9 h after spawning, the embryo became a concave-convex dish shape, then gastrulation occurred and the blastopore was formed. Seven-day old larvae were ellipsoid and about 700 ␮m long, with an open mouth at one end. Two weeks after spawning, the larvae developed a longitudinal band of long cilia (ϭ ventral ciliate band) that is characteristic of zoanthella larvae. In P. tuberculosa, larvae show a non-radial body plan and then metamorphose to almost-radial (in outward appearance) polyps after settlement. These results may support a hypothesis that a common ancestor of Cnidaria had a bilateral body plan that has been secondarily lost in some extant cnidarians.},

The models are tested on simulated data, and illustrated using microsatellite data from the CEPH Human Genome Diversity Panel. We demonstrate that the new models allow structure to be detected at lower levels of divergence, or with less data, than the original STRUCTURE models or principal components methods, and that they are not biased towards detecting structure when it is not present.

We investigate range-wide population genetic structure of the California spiny (or red rock) lobster (Panulirus interruptus) and find slight, but significant global population differentiation in mtDNA ({$\Phi$}ST ~=~0.006, P~=~0.001; Dest\_Chao ~=~0.025) and seven nuclear microsatellites (FST ~=~0.004, P~\&lt;~0.001; Dest\_Chao ~=~0.03), despite the species\&apos; 240- to 330-day pelagic larval duration. Significant population structure does not correlate with distance between sampling locations, and pairwise FST between adjacent sites often exceeds that among geographically distant locations. This result would typically be interpreted as unexplainable, chaotic genetic patchiness. However, kinship levels differ significantly among sites (pseudo-F16,988 ~=~1.39, P~=~0.001), and ten of 17 sample sites have significantly greater numbers of kin than expected by chance (P~\&lt;~0.05). Moreover, a higher proportion of kin within sites strongly correlates with greater genetic differentiation among sites (Dest\_Chao , R(2) ~=~0.66, P~\&lt;~0.005). Sites with elevated mean kinship were geographically proximate to regions of high upwelling intensity (R(2) ~=~0.41, P~=~0.0009). These results indicate that P.~interruptus does not maintain a single homogenous population, despite extreme dispersal potential. Instead, these lobsters appear to either have substantial localized recruitment or maintain planktonic larval cohesiveness whereby siblings more likely settle together than disperse across sites. More broadly, our results contribute to a growing number of studies showing that low FST and high family structure across populations can coexist, illuminating the foundations of cryptic genetic patterns and the nature of marine dispersal.},

Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

  abstract = {Traditional methods for characterizing genetic differentiation among populations rely on a priori grouping of individuals. Bayesian clustering methods avoid this limitation by using linkage and Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium to decompose a sample of individuals into genetically distinct groups. There are several software programs available for Bayesian clustering analyses, all of which describe a decrease in the ability to detect distinct clusters as levels of genetic differentiation among populations decrease. However, no study has yet compared the performance of such methods at low levels of population differentiation, which may be common in species where populations have experienced recent separation or high levels of gene flow. We used simulated data to evaluate the performance of three Bayesian clustering software programs, PARTITION, STRUCTURE, and BAPS, at levels of population differentiation below F-ST=0.1. PARTITION was unable to correctly identify the number of subpopulations until levels of F-ST reached around 0.09. Both STRUCTURE and BAPS performed very well at low levels of population differentiation, and were able to correctly identify the number of subpopulations at F-ST around 0.03. The average proportion of an individual\&apos;s genome assigned to its true population of origin increased with increasing F-ST for both programs, reaching over 92\% at an F-ST of 0.05. The average number of misassignments (assignments to the incorrect subpopulation) continued to decrease as F-ST increased, and when F-ST was 0.05, fewer than 3\% of individuals were misassigned using either program. Both STRUCTURE and BAPS worked extremely well for inferring the number of clusters when clusters were not well-differentiated (F-ST=0.02-0.03), but our results suggest that F-ST must be at least 0.05 to reach an assignment accuracy of greater than 97\%.},

Histories can also be reconstructed using the same procedure for groups that do not have admixture in their recent history, where recent genetic drift is strong or that deviate in other ways from the underlying inference model. Unfortunately, such histories can be misleading. We have implemented an approach, badMIXTURE, to assess the goodness of fit of the model using the ancestry ``palettes'' estimated by CHROMOPAINTER and apply it to both simulated data and real case studies. Combining these complementary analyses with additional methods that are designed to test specific hypotheses allows a richer and more robust analysis of recent demographic history.},

Imperfect genome maintenance leads to mutation accumulation in somatic cells, which is associated with tumors and senescence in vertebrates. Colonial reef-building corals are often large, can live for hundreds of years, rarely develop recognizable tumors, and are thought to convert somatic cells into gamete producers, so they are a pivotal group in which to understand long-term genome maintenance. To measure rates and patterns of somatic mutations, we analyzed transcriptomes from 17 to 22 branches from each of four Acropora hyacinthus colonies, determined putative single nucleotide variants, and verified them with Sanger resequencing. Unlike for human skin carcinomas, there is no signature of mutations caused by UV damage, indicating either higher efficiency of repair than in vertebrates, or strong sunscreen protection in these shallow water tropical animals. The somatic mutation frequency per nucleotide in A.~hyacinthus is on the same order of magnitude (10-7) as noncancerous human somatic cells, and accumulation of mutations with age is similar. Loss of heterozygosity variants outnumber gain of heterozygosity mutations {$\sim$}2:1. Although the mutation frequency is similar in mammals and corals, the preponderance of loss of heterozygosity changes and potential selection may reduce the frequency of deleterious mutations in colonial animals like corals. This may limit the deleterious effects of somatic mutations on the coral organism as well as potential offspring.},

Not needing to specify population size changes, split times, or whether admixture events were sudden or drawn out simplifies the space of models that need to be searched. However, the space of possible admixture graphs relating populations is vast and cannot be sampled fully, and thus most published studies have identified fitting admixture graphs through a manual process driven by prior hypotheses, leaving the vast majority of alternative models unexplored. Here, we develop a method for systematically searching the space of all admixture graphs that can incorporate non-genetic information in the form of topology constraints. We implement this             findGraphs             tool within a software package,             ADMIXTOOLS 2             , which is a reimplementation of the             ADMIXTOOLS             software with new features and large performance gains. We apply this methodology to identify alternative models to admixture graphs that played key roles in eight published studies and find that graphs modeling more than six populations and two or three admixture events are often not unique, with many alternative models fitting nominally or significantly better than the published one. Our results suggest that strong claims about population history from admixture graphs should only be made when all well-fitting and temporally plausible models share common topological features. Our re-evaluation of published data also provides insight into the population histories of humans, dogs, and horses, identifying features that are stable across the models we explored, as well as scenarios of populations relationships that differ in important ways from models that have been highlighted in the literature, that fit the allele frequency correlation data, and that are not obviously wrong.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Admixture, the interbreeding between previously distinct populations, is a pervasive force in evolution. The evolutionary history of populations in the presence of admixture can be modeled by augmenting phylogenetic trees with additional nodes that represent admixture events. While enabling a more faithful representation of evolutionary history, admixture graphs present formidable inferential challenges, and there is an increasing need for methods that are accurate, fully automated and computationally efficient. One key challenge arises from the size of the space of admixture graphs. Given that exhaustively evaluating all admixture graphs can be prohibitively expensive, heuristics have been developed to enable efficient search over this space. One heuristic, implemented in the popular method TreeMix, consists of adding edges to a starting tree while optimizing a suitable objective function.},

  abstract = {Background: Cnidarians, including corals and anemones, offer unique insights into metazoan evolution because they harbor genetic similarities with vertebrates beyond that found in model invertebrates and retain genes known only from non-metazoans. Cataloging genes expressed in Acropora palmata, a foundation-species of reefs in the Caribbean and western Atlantic, will advance our understanding of the genetic basis of ecologically important traits in corals and comes at a time when sequencing efforts in other cnidarians allow for multi-species comparisons. Results: A cDNA library from a sample enriched for symbiont free larval tissue was sequenced on the 454 GS-FLX platform. Over 960,000 reads were obtained and assembled into 42,630 contigs. Annotation data was acquired for 57\% of the assembled sequences. Analysis of the assembled sequences indicated that 83--100\% of all A. palmata transcripts were tagged, and provided a rough estimate of the total number genes expressed in our samples (,18,000--20,000). The coral annotation data contained many of the same molecular components as in the Bilateria, particularly in pathways associated with oxidative stress and DNA damage repair, and provided evidence that homologs of p53, a key player in DNA repair pathways, has experienced selection along the branch separating Cnidaria and Bilateria. Transcriptome wide screens of paralog groups and transition/transversion ratios highlighted genes including: green fluorescent proteins, carbonic anhydrase, and oxidative stress proteins; and functional groups involved in protein and nucleic acid metabolism, and the formation of structural molecules. These results provide a starting point for study of adaptive evolution in corals. Conclusions: Currently available transcriptome data now make comparative studies of the mechanisms underlying coral's evolutionary success possible. Here we identified candidate genes that enable corals to maintain genomic integrity despite considerable exposure to genotoxic stress over long life spans, and showed conservation of important physiological pathways between corals and bilaterians.},

Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admired individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

  abstract = {Zoanthus and Palythoa are benthic colonial zooxanthellate cnidarians common in shallow hard substrate marine ecosystems in subtropical and tropical regions, where they are an important component of coral and temperate reefs. However, recent studies have discovered areas where zoantharians dominate the benthos, potentially indicating a degraded or shifted reef state. In this review, we collated the available information on areas of high Zoanthus and Palythoa coverage. We found 34 reports from 19 locations and categorized them into three states: (1) \-``dominance''---dominant Zoanthus and Palythoa with no information on past states; (2) \-``barrens''---zoantharians have replaced another community, with no information on this state's persistence over time; and (3) ``phase shifts''---zoantharians have replaced another state and have been present for five years or longer. The reports encompass all subtropical/tropical oceans of the world. We confirmed only one zoantharian phase shift and noted eight cases each of barrens and zoantharian dominance. Records spanned from the late 19th century to the current day, and 12 of 19 instances were associated with anthropogenic impacts, primarily decreasing water quality. A temporal shift in zoantharian communities was also apparent, with historical records before the 1990s largely reporting intertidal zoantharian dominance while records that are more recent note subtidal zoantharian barrens. With shallow hard substrate ecosystems undergoing increasing degradation, knowledge regarding different possible states of these ecosystems, including Zoanthus and Palythoa outbreaks, is needed in order to recognize and report such events and track them over time and space.},

  abstract = {The genus Acropora comprises the most diverse and abundant scleractinian corals (Anthozoa, Cnidaria) in coral reefs, the most diverse marine ecosystems on Earth. However, the genetic basis for the success and wide distribution of Acropora are unknown. Here, we sequenced complete genomes of 15 Acropora species and 3 other acroporid taxa belonging to the genera Montipora and Astreopora to examine genomic novelties that explain their evolutionary success. We successfully obtained reasonable draft genomes of all 18 species. Molecular dating indicates that the Acropora ancestor survived warm periods without sea ice from the mid or late Cretaceous to the Early Eocene and that diversification of Acropora may have been enhanced by subsequent cooling periods. In general, the scleractinian gene repertoire is highly conserved; however, coral- or cnidarian-specific possible stress response genes are tandemly duplicated in Acropora. Enzymes that cleave dimethlysulfonioproprionate into dimethyl sulfide, which promotes cloud formation and combats greenhouse gasses, are the most duplicated genes in the Acropora ancestor. These may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer from algal symbionts belonging to the family Symbiodiniaceae, or from coccolithophores, suggesting that although functions of this enzyme in Acropora are unclear, Acropora may have survived warmer marine environments in the past by enhancing cloud formation. In addition, possible antimicrobial peptides and symbiosisrelated genes are under positive selection in Acropora, perhaps enabling adaptation to diverse environments. Our results suggest unique Acropora adaptations to ancient, warm marine environments and provide insights into its capacity to adjust to rising seawater temperatures.},

  abstract = {Population genetic studies reveal biodiversity patterns and inform about drivers of evolutionary differentiation and adaptation, including gene flow, drift and selection. This can advance our understanding and aid decision making regarding management and conservation efforts. Microsatellites have long been used in population genetic studies. Thanks to the development of newer techniques, sequencing approaches such as restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) are on their way to replace microsatellites for some applications. However, the performance of these two marker types in population genetics have rarely been systematically compared. We utilized three neutrally and adaptively differentiated populations of anadromous pike (Esox lucius) to assess the relative performance of microsatellites and RADseq with respect to resolution and conclusiveness of estimates of population differentiation and genetic structure. To this end, the same set of individuals (N = 64) were genotyped with both RADseq and microsatellite markers. To assess effects of sample size, the same subset of 10 randomly chosen individuals from each population (N = 30 in total) were also genotyped with both methods. Comparisons of estimated genetic diversity and structure showed that both markers were able to uncover genetic structuring. The full RADseq dataset provided the clearest detection of the finer scaled genetic structuring, and the other three datasets (full and subset microsatellite, and subset RADseq) provided comparable results. A search for outlier loci performed on the full SNP dataset pointed to signs of selection potentially associated with salinity and temperature, exemplifying the utility of RADseq to inform about the importance of different environmental factors. To evaluate whether performance differences between the markers are general or context specific, the results of previous studies that have investigated population structure using both marker types were synthesized. The synthesis revealed that RADseq performed as well as, or better than microsatellites in detecting genetic structuring in the included studies. The differences in the ability to detect population structure, both in the present and the previous studies, are likely explained by the higher number of loci typically utilized in RADseq compared to microsatellite analysis, as increasing the number of markers will (regardless of the marker type) increase power and allow for clearer detection and higher resolution of genetic structure.},

  abstract = {Despite the popularity of discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) for studying population structure, there has been little discussion of best practice for this method. In this work, I provide guidelines for standardizing the application of DAPC to genotype data sets. An often overlooked fact is that DAPC generates a model describing genetic differences among a set of populations defined by a researcher. Appropriate parameterization of this model is critical for obtaining biologically meaningful results. I show that the number of leading PC axes used as predictors of among-population differences, paxes, should not exceed the k-1 biologically informative PC axes that are expected for k effective populations in a genotype data set. This k-1 criterion for paxes specification is more appropriate compared to the widely used proportional variance criterion, which often results in a choice of paxes {$\gg$} k-1. DAPC parameterized with no more than the leading k-1 PC axes: (i) is more parsimonious; (ii) captures maximal among-population variation on biologically relevant predictors; (iii) is less sensitive to unintended interpretations of population structure; and (iv) is more generally applicable to independent sample sets. Assessing model fit should be routine practice and aids interpretation of population structure. It is imperative that researchers articulate their study goals, that is, testing a priori expectations vs. studying de novo inferred populations, because this has implications on how their DAPC results should be interpreted. The discussion and practical recommendations in this work provide the molecular ecology community with a roadmap for using DAPC in population genetic investigations.},

However, some nonbilaterians segregate the soma and germline late in development or never, leaving the evolutionary fate of their somatic mutations unknown. By investigating uni- and biparental reproduction in the coral Acropora palmata (Cnidaria, Anthozoa), we found that uniparental, meiotic offspring harbored 50\% of the 268 somatic mutations present in their parent. Thus, somatic mutations accumulated in adult coral animals, entered the germline, and were passed on to swimming larvae that grew into healthy juvenile corals. In this way, somatic mutations can increase allelic diversity and facilitate adaptation across habitats and generations in animals.},

  abstract = {Model-based (likelihood and Bayesian) and non-model-based (PCA and K-means clustering) methods were developed to identify populations and assign individuals to the identified populations using marker genotype data. Model-based methods are favoured because they are based on a probabilistic model of population genetics with biologically meaningful parameters and thus produce results that are easily interpretable and applicable. Furthermore, they often yield more accurate structure inferences than non-model-based methods. However, current model-based methods either are computationally demanding and thus applicable to small problems only or use simplified admixture models that could yield inaccurate results in difficult situations such as unbalanced sampling. In this study, I propose new likelihood methods for fast and accurate population admixture inference using genotype data from a few multiallelic microsatellites to millions of diallelic SNPs. The methods conduct first a clustering analysis of coarse-grained population structure by using the mixture model and the simulated annealing algorithm, and then an admixture analysis of fine-grained population structure by using the clustering results as a starting point in an expectation maximisation algorithm. Extensive analyses of both simulated and empirical data show that the new methods compare favourably with existing methods in both accuracy and running speed. They can analyse small datasets with just a few multiallelic microsatellites but can also handle in parallel terabytes of data with millions of markers and millions of individuals. In difficult situations such as many and/or lowly differentiated populations, unbalanced or very small samples of individuals, the new methods are substantially more accurate than other methods.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The transition/transversion (Ti/Tv) ratio and heterozygous/nonreference-homozygous (het/nonref-hom) ratio have been commonly computed in genetic studies as a quality control (QC) measurement. Additionally, these two ratios are helpful in our understanding of the patterns of DNA sequence evolution. Results: To thoroughly understand these two genomic measures, we performed a study using 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) released genotype data ( N = 1092). An additional two datasets ( N = 581 and N = 6) were used to validate our findings from the 1000G dataset. We compared the two ratios among continental ancestry, genome regions and gene functionality. We found that the Ti/Tv ratio can be used as a quality indicator for single nucleotide polymorphisms inferred from high-throughput sequencing data. The Ti/Tv ratio varies greatly by genome region and functionality, but not by ancestry. The het/nonref-hom ratio varies greatly by ancestry, but not by genome regions and functionality. Furthermore, extreme guanine + cytosine content (either high or low) is negatively associated with the Ti/Tv ratio magnitude. Thus, when performing QC assessment using these two measures, care must be taken to apply the correct thresholds based on ancestry and genome region. Failure to take these considerations into account at the QC stage will bias any following analysis.

  abstract = {Contemporary effective population size (Ne) can be estimated using linkage disequilibrium (LD) observed across pairs of loci presumed to be selectively neutral and unlinked. This method has been commonly applied to data sets containing 10--100 loci to inform conservation and study population demography. Performance of these Ne estimates could be improved by incorporating data from thousands of loci. However, these thousands of loci exist on a limited number of chromosomes, ensuring that some fraction will be physically linked. Linked loci have elevated LD due to limited recombination, which if not accounted for can cause Ne estimates to be downwardly biased. Here, we present results from coalescent and forward simulations designed to evaluate the bias of LD-based Ne estimates ({\^N}e). Contrary to common perceptions, increasing the number of loci does not increase the magnitude of linkage. Although we show it is possible to identify some pairs of loci that produce unusually large r2 values, simply removing large r2 values is not a reliable way to eliminate bias. Fortunately, the magnitude of bias in {\^N}e is strongly and negatively correlated with the process of recombination, including the number of chromosomes and their length, and this relationship provides a general way to adjust for bias. Additionally, we show that with thousands of loci, precision of {\^N}e is much lower than expected based on the assumption that each pair of loci provides completely independent information.},

  abstract = {Genetic methods are routinely used to estimate contemporary effective population size (N-e) in natural populations, but the vast majority of applications have used only the temporal (two-sample) method. We use simulated data to evaluate how highly polymorphic molecular markers affect precision and bias in the single-sample method based on linkage disequilibrium (LD). Results of this study are as follows: (1) Low-frequency alleles upwardly bias (N) over cap (e), but a simple rule can reduce bias to \&lt; about 10\% without sacrificing much precision. (2) With datasets routinely available today (10-20 loci with 10 alleles; 50 individuals), precise estimates can be obtained for relatively small populations (N-e \&lt; 200), and small populations are not likely to be mistaken for large ones. However, it is very difficult to obtain reliable estimates for large populations. (3) With \&apos;microsatellite\&apos; data, the LD method has greater precision than the temporal method, unless the latter is based on samples taken many generations apart. Our results indicate the LD method has widespread applicability to conservation (which typically focuses on small populations) and the study of evolutionary processes in local populations. Considerable opportunity exists to extract more information about N-e in nature by wider use of single-sample estimators and by combining estimates from different methods.},

  abstract = {Climate change threatens the survival of coral reefs on a global scale, primarily through mass bleaching and mortality as a result of marine heatwaves. While these short-term effects are clear, predicting the fate of coral reefs over the coming century is a major challenge. One way to understand the longer-term effect of rapid climate change is to examine the response of coral populations to past climate shifts. Coastal and shallow-water marine ecosystems such as coral reefs have been reshaped many times by sea-level changes during the Pleistocene, yet few studies have directly linked this with its consequences on population demographics, dispersal, and adaptation. Here we use powerful analytical techniques, afforded by haplotype-phased whole-genomes, to establish such links for the reef-building coral, Acropora digitifera. We show that three genetically distinct populations are present in northwestern Australia, and that their rapid divergence since the last glacial maximum (LGM) can be explained by a combination of founder-effects and restricted gene flow. Signatures of selective sweeps, too strong to be explained by demographic history, are present in all three populations and overlap with genes that show different patterns of functional enrichment between inshore and offshore habitats. In contrast to rapid divergence in the host, we find that photosymbiont communities are largely undifferentiated between corals from all three locations, spanning almost 1000\>km, indicating that selection on host genes, and not acquisition of novel symbionts, has been the primary driver of adaptation for this species in northwestern Australia.},
