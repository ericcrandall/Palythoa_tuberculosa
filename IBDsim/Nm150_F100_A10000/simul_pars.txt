Random Seeds : 14071789
nbr of simulated samples : 1 dataset(s) x 100 locus = 100
generic data file name: stepstone_radseq
Lattice with absorbing boundaries
nbr of loci per sample file (n_locus): 100
Postdisp Sample: nbr of sampled nodes: 9;
Postdisp sample: nbr of sampled individuals per sampled node (IndPerPopSampled): 10
Postdisp sample: x/y coordinate of "first" (bottom left) sampled node (xmin_sample/ymin_sample): 1/1

==============
Mutation model(s) (if multiple markers/loci have been specified, only the first locus of each marker is mentioned below):

JC69 Mutation rate (mu) is constant for this marker : 6e-06
==============

Demographic phase: 0
At G=0 (sampling time ==  present) : 
lattice dimensions are (LatticeSizeX * LatticeSizeY): 15 x 1
Diploid individuals : nbr of genes per non empty lattice node (2 * IndsPerPop): 100000
ContDemeSizeChange=Exponential
ContLatticeSizeChange=Linear


Dispersal model: b
Axial dispersal proba (TotalEmmigrationRate): 0.003
Stepping stone model 
Bounds (dx_max,dy_max)=(1,0)
Marginal dispersal distribution and checksum:
0 0.997 0.997
1 0.003 1

axial mean dispersal (within bounds): 0.003
axial sigma2 (within bounds): 0.003
axial kurtosis (within bounds): 330.333

If kurtosis appears wrong there may be many reasons
   It may be because the dispersal distribution is not
   computed with enough precision.

D sigma2 (within bounds): 300
Neighborhood  (within bounds): 600(1D) or 1884.96 (2D).
expected slope (within bounds): 0.00166667(1D) or 0.000530516 (2D).
