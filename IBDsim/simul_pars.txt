Random Seeds : 14071789
nbr of simulated samples : 10 dataset(s) x 3 locus = 30
generic data file name: Example_
Lattice with absorbing boundaries
nbr of loci per sample file (n_locus): 3
Postdisp Sample: nbr of sampled nodes (dim_sample1 X dim_sample2): 2 x 2
Postdisp sample: nbr of sampled individuals per sampled node (IndPerPopSampled): 5
Postdisp sample: x/y coordinate of "first" (bottom left) sampled node (xmin_sample/ymin_sample): 9/12

==============
Mutation model(s) (if multiple markers/loci have been specified, only the first locus of each marker is mentioned below):

 Mutation rate (mu) is constant for this marker : 6.42285e-323
==============

Demographic phase: 0
At G=0 (sampling time ==  present) : 
lattice dimensions are (LatticeSizeX * LatticeSizeY): 20 x 20
Haploid individuals : nbr of genes per lattice node (1* IndsPerPop): 30


Dispersal model: b
Axial dispersal proba (TotalEmmigrationRate): 0.05
Stepping stone model 
Bounds (dx_max,dy_max)=(1,1)
Marginal dispersal distribution and checksum:
0 0.95 0.95
1 0.05 1

axial mean dispersal (within bounds): 0.05
axial sigma2 (within bounds): 0.05
axial kurtosis (within bounds): 17

If kurtosis appears wrong there may be many reasons
   It may be because the dispersal distribution is not
   computed with enough precision.

D sigma2 (within bounds): 1.5
Neighborhood  (within bounds): 3(1D) or 9.42478 (2D).
expected slope (within bounds): 0.333333(1D) or 0.106103 (2D).
